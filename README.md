Here we have performed human emotion recognition from audio-visual data on two datasets the RAVDESS and the SAVEE dataset using CNNs as both our audio and video models. We have extracted the video features using the in-built OpenCV face detector that can be implemented using the .caffemodel and .prototxt files. Audio features have been extracted using librosa library. Our results are as follows:-  

For RAVDESS dataset we get a test accuracy of 77.77%

For SAVEE dataset we get a test accuracy of
